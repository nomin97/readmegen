  # Readme Generator
  
  ## Description 
  Uses node to create a readme right from the command line. This was a server side application so there is no deployed page, and this was a first time using node, including packages, linking other javascript files to the index.js. Using inquirer was fun and straightforward, it was intersting to work only on VS code and the command line, without needing the browser. In many ways that made it more efficient. This will be a useful application what I can use on my future projects. It helps to cut down the time spent on creating the readme, and the user can also go back to the created readme and add/edit it.
